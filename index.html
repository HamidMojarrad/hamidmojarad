                    <h1>PhD Student at University of Düsseldorf</h1>
                    <p text-align="left">As a DAAD scholarship holder, I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in English Language and Linguistics at Heinrich Heine University (HHU) Düsseldorf, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Kevin Tang, beginning in April 2024. My research concentrates on Automatic Speech Recognition, with a particular emphasis on uncovering potential biases against the African American English community.</p>
                    <br>
					<p text-align="left">I hold an M.A. in Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) earned in 2014, a B.A. in English Translation obtained in 2010, and a B.Sc. in Software Engineering completed in 2004. Additionally, I served as a Research Assistant (R.A.) for two years, collaborating with Prof. Dr. Fatemeh Hemmati on E-Learning among TEFL M.A. students of Payame Noor University (PNU) in Iran. My research interests span various areas, including Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Learning (ICALL), Technology-Enhanced Language Learning (TELL), and Computational Linguistics (CL).</p>
					<br>
					<p text-align="left">I possess extensive experience as a Java developer, with a specialized focus on the Spring framework. I have also worked with C++ and C# for console applications and web development. As for front-end development, I know how to develop apps with Javascrip frameworks especially React.js for web and React Native for mobile development. For the time being, I am training myself with Python especially for deep learning purposes to implement my PhD thesis.</p>

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <h3>Automatic Speech Recognition</h3>
            <p>I am currently working on Automatic speech Recognition (ASR) and the relevant subfields. My PhD research is mitigating bias in ASR systems against African American English (AAE) community.
                I will specifically work on AAE phonological features and their interaction with AAE morpho-syntactic features and how it will affect the performance of ASR systems.
                I will utilise tools like Montreal Forced Alignment and Aeneas library as well as Python Deep learning algorithms to implement the research.
            </p>
            <h3>Computer Assisted Language Learning</h3>
            <p>Based on my MA's field of research which concerned TEFL, I chose to work on a combination of computer science and teaching/learning. For that, I conducted two research projects on E-learning and it's role in English language learning and testing.
                This was a basis for my interest towards what is called Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Learning (ICALL). I were to continue this line of research in my PhD at the University of Tubingen, Germany; however, ASR interested me further, and I decided to choose it eventually.
