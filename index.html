                <h2>PhD Student at University of Düsseldorf</h2>
                <p text-align="left">As a DAAD scholarship holder, I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in English Language and Linguistics at Heinrich Heine University (HHU) Düsseldorf, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Kevin Tang, beginning in April 2024. My research concentrates on Automatic Speech Recognition, with a particular emphasis on uncovering potential biases against the African American English community.</p>
                    <br>
					<p text-align="left">I hold an M.A. in Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) earned in 2014, a B.A. in English Translation obtained in 2010, and a B.Sc. in Software Engineering completed in 2004. Additionally, I served as a Research Assistant (R.A.) for two years, collaborating with Prof. Dr. Fatemeh Hemmati on E-Learning among TEFL M.A. students of Payame Noor University (PNU) in Iran. My research interests span various areas, including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Learning (ICALL), Technology-Enhanced Language Learning (TELL), and E-learning.</p>
					<br>
					<p text-align="left">I possess extensive experience as a Java developer, with a specialized focus on the Spring framework. I have also worked with C++ and C# for console applications and web development. As for front-end development, I know how to develop apps with Javascrip frameworks especially React.js for web and React Native for mobile development. For the time being, I am training myself with Python especially for deep learning purposes to implement my PhD thesis.</p>

                    <h3>Automatic Speech Recognition</h3>
                    <p>I am currently focused on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and its related subfields under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Kevin Tang, who kindly introduced me to this area. My PhD research aims to address bias in ASR systems against the African American English (AAE) community. I will specifically examine the phonological features of AAE and their interaction with morpho-syntactic features, analyzing how these factors influence the performance of ASR systems. To carry out this research, I will leverage tools such as Montreal Forced Alignment and the Aeneas library, along with Python deep learning algorithms.</p>

                    <h3>Computer Assisted Language Learning</h3>
                    <p>Drawing from my Master’s research in Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL), I decided to explore the intersection of computer science and language learning/teaching. To this end, I undertook two research projects focused on e-learning and its impact on English language acquisition and assessment. This experience interested me in what is known as Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Learning (ICALL). I intended to pursue this research line for my PhD under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Detmar Meurers at the University of Tübingen, Germany. However, my enthusiasm towards Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) ultimately led me to choose it as my primary focus.</p>
